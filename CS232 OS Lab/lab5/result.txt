For testing webserver_dynamic:
	To initialize a server use the following command in /home/ishan_acharyya/lab5/web_server
	./webserver_dynamic 7077

	The following command will initialize a client 'A' that will copy all webdocs to /home/ishan_acharyya/lab5/test/test1
	wget -P test1 -nd -p localhost:7077/index.html

	The following command will initialize a client 'B' that will copy all webdocs to /home/ishan_acharyya/lab5/test/test2
	wget -P test2 -nd -p localhost:7077/index.html

1)Ensure that test1 and test 2 are empty
2)Initialize server
3)Initialize A
	After it finishes, we can verify the files in test1 and see the data provided in the terminal running A
Result in my run:-
Total wall clock time: 25s
Downloaded: 21 files, 3.3M in 25s
4)Clear test1
5)Run Step 3 for A and B simultaneously with minimum delay
 After it finishes, we will notice:
Result in my run:-
For A:
Total wall clock time: 25s
Downloaded: 21 files, 3.3M in 25s
For B:
Total wall clock time: 25s
Downloaded: 21 files, 3.3M in 25s

We can see that the data is transferred as intended 
and the max time taken in step 5 is 25 s, which ic less than step 2 time *2 [50 s] had it been a single threaded server serving two clients
